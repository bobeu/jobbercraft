JobberCraft is a decentraized freelancing platform. Coined from the words: Hire and Work. A true freelance 
platform that connects job creators with job seekers using smart agreement in a manner that removes centralization, yet enforces 
quality with convenient means of paymenta platform where Hirer finds the best hand for their jobs. 

- Experienced, qualified and approved Job seekers can pick up a job, complete it within set deadline 
    , and automatically receive the pay soon as hirer confirms job done. This action is final and
    irreversible.
    JobberCraft protects both the Hirer and Job seekers in the context of each contract agreement.

    It is mandatory for Job seekers to sign up and complete an initial test, based on their fields.
    NB: JobberCraft might use a third party service. 

    Steps
    -----
    o Hirer interacts with JobberCraft using externally owned accounts using a web3 wallet e.g Metamask.
    o Hirer publishes job opportunity. 
      - When function is called, Hirer prefunds the contract with the offer amount. by minting an NFT
          which acts a placeholder for the posted jobs on JobberCraft.

          When a job publication is made, a link to the job hosted on our github org or elsewhere is

HOW WE PLAN TO MANAGE JOBS
--------------------------
- Tentatively, JobberCraft will coordinate all jobs under one github baseURI 
using organization account standard. 
- Approved Jobbers are added to the organization's github team's page
    all members must own a github account.
- Hirer could be added to our page or rather use their personal github
    account to host the job.
